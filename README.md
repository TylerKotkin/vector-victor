#  <div align="center">Vector Victor</div>

Vector Victor implements various vector and matrix math functions using no third-party libraries, only built-in operators and the math module. These functions were written using list comprehensions without traditional `for` or `while` loops. All functions are contained in `linear_algebra.py`.

The following linear algebra functions were created:
* vector addition and subtraction
* vector multiplication by a scalar
* mean of multiple vectors
* dot product
* magnitude

* To run the included tests, the user must first clone the vector-victor repo onto their computer. The user must have Python 3 and nose installed in order to run the tests. After cloning the repo, the user must use a command-line program to navigate to the folder in which the vector-victor repo was saved and then type `nosetests test_linear_algebra.py` on the command-line.
